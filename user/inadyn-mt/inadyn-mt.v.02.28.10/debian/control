Description: Dynamic DNS Client
 INADYN-MT is a dynamic DNS client. It maintains the IP address of
 a host name. It periodically checks wheather the IP address stored
 by the DSN server is the real current address of the machine that
 is running INADYN-MT.
 .
 Before using inadyn-mt for the first time you must use the DynDNS
 provider's web interface to create the entry for the hostname. You
 should then fill in /etc/inadyn.conf with the appropriate detail
